Physics is provided by the Box2D physics engine.

** Body Definition

Body definition is provided by Blang, the body definition language.  This can be found under the namespace _gamespecs.blang_.

Blang provides a set of operators for defining multiple-body entities and multiple-fixture bodies.  The primary operators used are the macros _bod_ and _fix_, which allows for the specification of a hierarchical tree of transformation matrices, along with body and fixture definitions.


*** Blang Operators
    - fix :: Fixture definition
      - params :: [&{:keys [transforms shape density friction restitution]}]
      - This function does some stuff. 
    - ffsdf ::
